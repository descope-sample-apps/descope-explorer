# Descope Explorer 🔍

Welcome to Descope Explorer. A quick and easy way to view Descope project authentication flows. <br>
All you need to do is format the URL with the correct parameters. The following URL is hosted on localhost 3000 but yours may be different: 

```

> **_NOTE:_**  If you do not include the flow parameter, it will use the default sign-up-or-in flow id.
