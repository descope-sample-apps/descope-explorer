# Descope Explorer

Welcome to Descope Explorer. An easy way to preview and interact with Descope authentication flows. <br>
All you need to do is format the URL with the correct parameters. The following URL is hosted on localhost 3000 but yours may be different: 

```
http://localhost:3000/?project=PROJECT_ID&flow=FLOW_ID&theme=light
```

> **_NOTE:_**  If you do not include the flow parameter, it will use the default sign-up-or-in flow id. If you do not include a theme parameter, it will use light as the default.
